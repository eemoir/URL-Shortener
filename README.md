# URL-Shortener

This is my code for the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/url-shortener-microservice">URL Shortener Microservice project</a> from the Free Code Camp backend certification.

Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://little-url.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to Glitch.

User Stories: 

- I can pass a URL as a parameter and I will receive a shortened URL in the JSON response.

- If I pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the valid http://www.example.com format, the JSON response will contain an error instead.

- When I visit that shortened URL, it will redirect me to my original link.
